# Multiplication World

## Level 2: `mul_one`

Remember that you can see everything you have proved so far about multiplication in
the drop-down box on the left (and that this list will grow as we proceed).

In this level we'll need to use

* `one_eq_succ_zero : 1 = succ(0)`

which was mentioned back in Addition World and
which will be a useful thing to rewrite right now, as we
begin to prove a couple of lemmas about how `1` behaves
with respect to multiplication.

/- Lemma
For any natural number $m$, we have
