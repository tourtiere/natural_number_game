# Addition World

## Level 5: `succ_eq_add_one`

I've just added `one_eq_succ_zero` (a proof of `1 = succ(0)`) to your list of theorems; this is true
by definition of $1$, but we didn't need it until now.

Levels 5 and 6 are the two last levels in Addition World.
Level 5 involves the number $1$. When you see a $1$ in your goal,
you can write `rw one_eq_succ_zero` to get back
to something which only mentions `0`. This is a good move because $0$ is easier for us to
manipulate than $1$ right now, because we have
some theorems about $0$ (`zero_add`, `add_zero`), but, other than `1 = succ(0)`,
no theorems at all which mention $1$. Let's prove one now.
