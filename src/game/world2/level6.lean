# Addition World

## Level 6: `add_right_comm`

Lean sometimes writes `a + b + c`. What does it mean? The convention is
that if there are no brackets displayed in an addition formula, the brackets
are around the left most `+` (Lean's addition is "left associative"). 
So the goal in this level is `(a + b) + c = (a + c) + b`. This isn't
quite `add_assoc` or `add_comm`, it's something you'll have to prove
by putting these two theorems together.

If you hadn't picked up on this already, `rw add_assoc` will
change `(x + y) + z` to `x + (y + z)`, but to change it back
you will need `rw ← add_assoc`. Get the left arrow by typing `\l`
then the space bar (note that this is L for left, not a number 1).
Similarly, if `h : a = b` then `rw h` will change `a`'s to `b`'s
and `rw ← h` will change `b`'s to `a`'s.

Also, you can be (and will need to be, in this level) more precise
about where to rewrite theorems. `rw add_comm,` will just find the
first `? + ?` it sees and swap it around. You can target more specific
additions like this: `rw add_comm a` will swap around
additions of the form `a + ?`, and `rw add_comm a b,` will only
swap additions of the form `a + b`.

## Where next?

There are thirteen more levels about addition after this one, but before
you can attempt them you need to learn some more tactics. So after this
level you have a choice -- either move on to Multiplication World (which you can
solve with the tactics you know) or try Function World (and learn some new ones).
After solving this level, click "Main Menu" in the top left to take you back
to the overworld, and make your choice. Other things, perhaps of interest
to some players, are mentioned below the lemma.

/- Lemma
For all natural numbers $a, b$ and $c$, we have
$$ a + b + c = a + c + b. $$
-/
lemma add_right_comm (a b c : mynat) : a + b + c = a + c + b :=
begin [nat_num_game]
    rw add_assoc,
    rw add_comm(b),rw add_assoc(a),refl,
end

/-
If you have got this far, then you have become very good at
manipulating equalities in Lean. You can also now collect
four collectibles (or `instance`s, as Lean calls them)

```
mynat.add_semigroup -- (after level 2)
mynat.add_monoid -- (after level 2)
mynat.add_comm_semigroup mynat (after level 4)
mynat.add_comm_monoid -- (after level 4)
```

In Multiplication World you will be able to collect such
advanced collectibles as `mynat.comm_semiring` and
`mynat.distrib`, and then move on to power world and
the famous collectible at the end of it.

One last thing -- didn't you think that solving this level
`add_right_comm` was boring? Check out this AI that can do it for us.

First we have to get the `add_comm_monoid` collectible,
which we do by saying the magic words which make Lean's type class inference
system give it to us.

instance : add_comm_monoid mynat := by structure_helper



/-
Now the `simp` AI becomes accessible (it's just an advanced
tactic really), and can nail some really tedious-for-a-human-to-solve
goals. For example check out this one-line proof:
-/

example (a b c d e : mynat) :
(((a+b)+c)+d)+e=(c+((b+e)+a))+d := begin
    sorry,
end 

/-
Imagine having to do that one by hand! The AI closes the goal
because it knows how to use associativity and commutativity
sensibly in a commutative monoid.

You are now done with addition world. Go back to the main menu (top left)
and decide whether to press on with multiplication world and power world
(which can be solved with `rw`, `refl` and `induction`), or to go on
to Function World where you can learn the tactics needed to prove
goals of the form $P\implies Q$, thus enabling you to solve more
advanced addition world levels such as $a+t=b+t\implies a=b$. Note that
Function World is more challenging mathematically; but if you can do Addition
World you can surely do Multiplication World and Power World.

/- Tactic : simp

## Summary

The `simp` tactic is a high-level tactic which tries
to prove equalities using facts in its database (such
as `add_assoc` and `add_comm`).

## Details

The `simp` tactic does basic automation. By level 6 of
Addition World you
have proved enough about addition for `simp` to be able
to solve all equalities whose proofs involve a tedious number
of rewrites of `add_assoc` and `add_comm`, and by
level 9 of Multiplication World the same is true of `mul_assoc` and `mul_comm`.

### Example:
If our goal is this:
```
⊢ a + b + c + d + e = c + (b + e + a) + d
```

and you have completed addition world, then you've proved
enough about addition to solve this level with `simp`. 
Note however that you can't prove `add_assoc` with `simp`,
because `add_assoc` is an ingredient to get `simp` working.

### Example:
If our goal is this:
```
⊢ a * b * c = c * b * a
```
then as long as you've completed Multiplication World, `simp` will close this
goal.
