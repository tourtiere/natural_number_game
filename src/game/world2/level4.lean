# Addition World

## Level 4: `add_comm` (boss level)

[boss battle music]

Look in Theorem statements -> Addition world to see the proofs you have.
These should be enough.

/- Lemma
On the set of natural numbers, addition is commutative.
In other words, for all natural numbers $a$ and $b$, we have
$$ a + b = b + a. $$
-/
lemma add_comm (a b : mynat) : a + b = b + a :=
begin [nat_num_game]
    sorry,
end

If you got this far -- nice! You're nearly ready to make a choice:
Multiplication World or Function World. But there are just a couple
more useful lemmas in Addition World which you should prove first.
Press on to level 5.
