## Level 3: `succ_add`

Oh no! On the way to `add_comm`, a wild `succ_add` appears. `succ_add`
is the proof that `succ(a) + b = succ(a + b)` for `a` and `b` in your
natural number type. We need to prove this now, because we will need
to use this result in our proof that `a + b = b + a` in the next level.

NB: think about why computer scientists called this result `succ_add` .
There is a logic to all the names.

Note that if you want to be more precise about exactly where you want
to rewrite something like `add_succ` (the proof you already have),
you can do things like `rw add_succ (succ a)` or
`rw add_succ (succ a) d`, telling Lean explicitly what to use for
the input variables for the function `add_succ`. Indeed, `add_succ`
is a function -- it takes as input two variables `a` and `b` and outputs a proof
that `a + succ(b) = succ(a + b)`. The tactic `rw add_succ` just says to Lean "guess
what the variables are".
