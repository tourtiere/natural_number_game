# Advanced Addition World

## Level 1: `succ_inj`. A function.

Peano's original collection of axioms for the natural numbers contained two further
assumptions, which have not yet been mentioned in the game:

```
succ_inj {a b : mynat} :
  succ(a) = succ(b) → a = b

zero_ne_succ (a : mynat) :
  zero ≠ succ(a)
 ```

The reason they have not been used yet is that they are both implications,
that is,
of the form $P\implies Q$. This is clear for `succ_inj a b`, which
says that for all $a$ and $b$ we have $succ(a)=succ(b)\implies a=b$.
For `zero_ne_succ` the trick is that $X\ne Y$ is *defined to mean*
$X = Y\implies{\tt false}$. If you have played through Proposition world,
you now have the required Lean skills (i.e., you know the required
tactics) to work with these implications.
Let's finally learn how to use `succ_inj`. You should know a couple
of ways to prove the below -- one directly using an `exact`,
and one which uses an `apply` first. But either way you'll need to use `succ_inj`.

/- Theorem : no-side-bar
For all naturals $a$ and $b$, if we assume $succ(a)=succ(b)$, then we can
deduce $a=b$. 
-/
theorem succ_inj' {a b : mynat} (hs : succ(a) = succ(b)) :  a = b := 
begin [nat_num_game]
    sorry,
end

## Important thing.

You can rewrite proofs of *equalities*. If `h : A = B` then `rw h` changes `A`s to `B`s.
But you *cannot rewrite proofs of implications*. `rw succ_inj` will *never work*
because `succ_inj` isn't of the form $A = B$, it's of the form $A\implies B$. This is one
of the most common mistakes I see from beginners. $\implies$ and $=$ are *two different things*
and you need to be clear about which one you are using.
