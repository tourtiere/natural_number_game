## Level 14: `add_le_add_left`

I know these are easy and we've done several already, but this is one
of the axioms for an ordered commutative monoid! The nature of formalising
is that we should formalise all "obvious" lemmas, and then when we're
actually using $\le$ in real life, everything will be there. Note also,
of course, that all of these lemmas are already formalised in Lean's
maths library already, for Lean's inbuilt natural numbers.
